# Major Key

If you've been here before, you're probably wondering *where did everything go?* And if you're new here, then you're probably wondering why I'm being so presumptuous.

Welcome to Major-Key. This was originally my Master's project and has become my new personal project. When I came back to this code, I tried to work with it as it was but it was *ugly*. I'm talking, like, really bad. So I decided it was better to just start from scratch. If you're interested in seeing how bad a coder I was, feel free to look at the repo history. Hopefully I've gotten better since then!

This iteration of the project is in very early stages of development! So come along for the ride -- it's gonna be fun!
